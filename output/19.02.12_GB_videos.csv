Which they referred to as Resting Fish Face.¬†But then‚Ä¶well something peculiar happened‚Ä¶or I mean‚Ä¶someone peculiar happened.The Boy was... peculiar... from the moment he entered the world. No one ever meant to be mean towards him, but in a town grown used to way things were, no one knew what to do with something... different. They did their very best to ignore it... hoping it would go away... and eventually so did The Boy. He had lost his smile and without it the world grew darker, the wind colder, and the ocean more violent. The Boy was not alone in his melancholy.He wondered what could bring despair to something so beautiful.He tried to ignore the fish, but loneliness is an ocean full of travelers trying to find their place in the world.But without friendship, we are all lost and left with no hope, no home, no harbor.¬†He wondered what cruel twist of fate brought them together, and if fate was indeed involved, what did she have in store.Pre-order Harry Styles‚Äô new album ‚ÄòFine Line‚Äô now: https://HStyles.lnk.to/FineLinePSPAAY HARRY STYLES.

At the time of the disaster, it was the largest and most advanced ship ever constructed. Designed to carry more than 2,400 passengers and almost 900 crewmembers, the Titanic had certainly earned its name.But with over a century of advancement, how are today‚Äôs cruise ships different from those of Titanic‚Äôs day? Sure, we all know they‚Äôre now required to carry more lifeboats, but that isn‚Äôt exactly what makes them the life of the party.

The ship‚Äôs nine decks rose to an impressive 175 ft.- The SS Imperator would steal its crown a year later when it undertook his maiden voyage in 1913. - As of 2019, the largest cruise ship in the world is the Symphony of the Seas, which is operated by Royal Caribbean.- 1184 ft across and 215 ft wide, her eighteen decks are double the Titanic‚Äôs height and provide spacious accommodations for well over five thousand passengers. - Think of it as the difference between a city bus and a tour bus. You board a cruise ship to have fun and an ocean liner when you need to get somewhere.- First-class passengers would enjoy a saltwater pool, spa, gymnasium, and multiple restaurants decorated in the styles of French caf√©s and swanky New York hotels. - Second-class rooms were smaller and not as glamorous, but luxuriously furnished.- Third Class, also known as steerage, wasn't quite so luxurious, although the accommodations were still nicer than on many ships of the same era.- Modern cruise ships don‚Äôt really have classes in the way as the Titanic or even modern airlines. - Even the least expensive room on a cruise ship is still going to be about the level of a modest hotel room.- In addition to TVs and in-room slides, there are many other amenities found on modern cruise ships that wouldn‚Äôt have been available in the early twentieth century.- Shipbuilding had to come a long way before these immense mobile vacation spots became a reality.- The Titanic was constructed in Belfast harbor on a special slipway built specifically to accommodate its unprecedented bulk.- The hull of the Titanic was made up of thousands of these overlapping plates with the lower hull consisting of two layers. - Titanic's primary safety feature was the sixteen watertight compartments making up the lower decks. - Ships of today are still made from steel, but advancements in smelting and metallurgy have resulted in hulls stronger and less brittle than were possible a hundred years ago. - Speaking of the engines, modern cruise ships run primarily on either diesel, natural gas, or some combination of the two. - The most unusual aspect of modern cruise construction is that they're not built hull to funnel as a single construction. - The largest cruise ships and oil tankers are assembled in just six locations worldwide, the most prolific being the Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in South Korea.

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area.  About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7During the Tesla Cybertruck reveal Elon Musk showed the world that the Cybertruck can pull a Ford F-150, uphill! At initial glance, you might think wow, that's an impressive feat. Surely the Tesla's electric torque helps it rip the F-150 in this battle of who's got the bigger driveshaft? Unfortunately, physics informs us these kind of demonstrations are entirely pointless.We'll discuss the actual wheel torque of the Tesla Cybertruck as well as the Ford F-150, we'll look into both vehicles weights, and we'll analyze the video to determine if the Ford is RWD or 4WD. Ultimately, we'll all land on the conclusion that everything we witnessed was pointless. That's the story of life. Enjoy!

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! Growing up, Lizzie never realized how deeply she was affected by what she saw on the news and experienced at school. But when she took the time to look back, she started to understand that events she experienced really impacted her way of thinking and daily life, and the level of her anxiety. When Lizzie was younger, she lived at Fort Hood - the biggest U.S. military base in the country. She was there when a horrible shooting happened. The day after the horrific event, she went to school and saw armed guards surrounding the building. When she approached a guard, he assured her that he was there to protect her. But because Lizzie was so young, she didn't understand why she needed to be protected at school. At such a young age, the whole thing was really confusing. Then, when Lizzie was in middle school, another student brought a weapon to school. The student was caught before he was able to use his weapon, and the school was able to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. However, even though Lizzie was so grateful that things didn't escalate, the whole experience still really scared her. After that, Lizzie felt a similar sense of fear, confusion and sadness when she heard about the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook. She couldn't imagine how the victims must have felt, and she hugged her younger brother and told him she loved him after hearing about what happened on the news. Then, when Lizzie was a senior in high school, she found out about another tragedy at Stoneman Douglas. As much as it broke her heart to hear about yet another school shooting, Lizzie couldn't help but feel numb to the pain - and that scared her even more. After each event, Lizzie became more anxious in her daily life. When her school had an active shooter drill, she couldn't help but fear the worst, and she immediately texted her brother to make sure he was okay. Lizzie believes that, although this is hard for anyone to comprehend, it is especially difficult for kids and teenagers. She doesn't understand why her generation has to feel any sense of fear when walking into a school, going to a store or heading to a movie. She may think to herself, When did this become normal? However, Lizzie has hope for the future. She thinks that her generation will be the change that the world needs to make a difference, and she is hopeful that future generations will not have experience what Lizzie and her classmates went through.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!
