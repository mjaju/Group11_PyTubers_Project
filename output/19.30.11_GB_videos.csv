I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area.  About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber. #PrimitiveTechnology"

Doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but it‚Äôs a lot when you‚Äôre in your late twenties and haven‚Äôt run since gym class back in school. Not to mention the barely-there energy and weight gain that adulthood seemed to hit me with. Anyway, I had a month to get ready. How did I do it?The short answer is, baby steps! Of course, you should watch what you eat, stay hydrated, and train slowly but surely. After getting myself a new pair of running shoes, my journey began. I kept a daily log of my progress along the way. What about you? Are you ready to lace up your shoes and start running?Other videos you might like:I Decided to Sleep for 4 Hours a Day, See What Happened https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbFzL-0pEeU&What If You Stopped Drinking Water for 7 Days? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0aOXbODp1w&Plank Every Day for a Month, See What Happens to Your Body https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC9KIGDOkGcTIMESTAMPS:What I started with 0:56Foods that fuel running 1:42Why I found a running group 2:29Cross-training 3:00Something amazing happened! 3:13My weight 4:03A new wind of motivation 5:02My complexion is... wow! 6:04Lots of bananas 7:59I did it! 8:29üî¥ Tips I can give üî¥ 8:44#running #workout #brightsideSUMMARY:- The idea is to walk for 2 minutes, jog for 1 minute, and repeat that over and over again until your jogs hit the 30-minute mark. - Foods that fuel running include bananas, oats, peanut butter, broccoli, plain yogurt, dark chocolate, whole grain pasta, potatoes, and coffee. - Sore today too after that insane gym sesh. I guess that‚Äôs just gonna be a regular thing for the next month.- My trainer suggested cycling as cross-training, so I went on a 3-mile bike ride.- My energy levels are through the roof! I no longer crave afternoon naps. - I weighed myself today, and I‚Äôm down 5 pounds! I‚Äôm convinced jogging is the fastest way to lose weight.- I jogged for 10 solid minutes today and didn‚Äôt struggle at all! I‚Äôm getting there!- My trainer told me to be extra careful to stay hydrated. He said to divide my body weight in half, and then drink an ounce per pound. - I guess exercise improves your complexion because it boosts blood circulation. - My trainer showed me how to use a tennis ball to massage any problem areas. I do it to the bottoms of my feet, too.- Listening to music while jogging helps the time go a lot faster. - Lots of bananas. I‚Äôm told the potassium will help balance the electrolytes I lose on longer runs.- I think my training program must‚Äôve been just right because the run was relatively easy and enjoyable.

Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7During the Tesla Cybertruck reveal Elon Musk showed the world that the Cybertruck can pull a Ford F-150, uphill! At initial glance, you might think wow, that's an impressive feat. Surely the Tesla's electric torque helps it rip the F-150 in this battle of who's got the bigger driveshaft? Unfortunately, physics informs us these kind of demonstrations are entirely pointless.We'll discuss the actual wheel torque of the Tesla Cybertruck as well as the Ford F-150, we'll look into both vehicles weights, and we'll analyze the video to determine if the Ford is RWD or 4WD. Ultimately, we'll all land on the conclusion that everything we witnessed was pointless. That's the story of life. Enjoy!

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! Growing up, Lizzie never realized how deeply she was affected by what she saw on the news and experienced at school. But when she took the time to look back, she started to understand that events she experienced really impacted her way of thinking and daily life, and the level of her anxiety. When Lizzie was younger, she lived at Fort Hood - the biggest U.S. military base in the country. She was there when a horrible shooting happened. The day after the horrific event, she went to school and saw armed guards surrounding the building. When she approached a guard, he assured her that he was there to protect her. But because Lizzie was so young, she didn't understand why she needed to be protected at school. At such a young age, the whole thing was really confusing. Then, when Lizzie was in middle school, another student brought a weapon to school. The student was caught before he was able to use his weapon, and the school was able to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. However, even though Lizzie was so grateful that things didn't escalate, the whole experience still really scared her. After that, Lizzie felt a similar sense of fear, confusion and sadness when she heard about the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook. She couldn't imagine how the victims must have felt, and she hugged her younger brother and told him she loved him after hearing about what happened on the news. Then, when Lizzie was a senior in high school, she found out about another tragedy at Stoneman Douglas. As much as it broke her heart to hear about yet another school shooting, Lizzie couldn't help but feel numb to the pain - and that scared her even more. After each event, Lizzie became more anxious in her daily life. When her school had an active shooter drill, she couldn't help but fear the worst, and she immediately texted her brother to make sure he was okay. Lizzie believes that, although this is hard for anyone to comprehend, it is especially difficult for kids and teenagers. She doesn't understand why her generation has to feel any sense of fear when walking into a school, going to a store or heading to a movie. She may think to herself, When did this become normal? However, Lizzie has hope for the future. She thinks that her generation will be the change that the world needs to make a difference, and she is hopeful that future generations will not have experience what Lizzie and her classmates went through.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

That‚Äôs because it was her first televised performance in 2 years. The last time Selena performed live at an awards show was also at the American Music Awards in 2017, when she performed her new collaboration with Marshmallow - ‚ÄúWolves‚Äù.Selena has won one American Music Award, back in 2016 for ‚ÄúFavorite Pop/Rock female artist‚Äù. This year though, she wasn‚Äôt nominated for any - since her music came out too late to be qualified. But she was still asked to perform and open up the ceremony. And the stakes were twice as high for Selena, who performed not one but two of her brand new songs to open up the award show. And she certainly gave an emotional performance. She started off crooning to her slow-jam ‚ÄúLose You To Love Me‚Äù in a long black turtleneck. Afterwards she transformed into a disco queen with a VERY quick costume change into this sequined body-suit.She followed up her first single with her brand new hit ‚ÄúLook at Her Now‚Äù. And her friends Halsey and Taylor were cheering her on the entire way. But people online were a little less supportive.Some people accused her of lip-syncing her second song, ‚ÄúLook at Her Now‚Äù, while other people actually said that she SHOULD have lip-synced both of her songs. That‚Äôs because her performance of ‚ÄúLook at her now‚Äù was a bit different than the recorded version that we‚Äôre used to. This past week, Selena announced her upcoming album will come out on January 10, 2020. Right now, it‚Äôs expected to be a self-titled album, or called ‚ÄúSG2‚Äù, but we‚Äôre supposed to get more details on that in the next few weeks. So I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing what comes from that.But in the meantime, keep watching our American Music Awards coverage tonight, because we‚Äôve still got a lot coming your way!

It doesn‚Äôt matter which diet plan you are following right now to lose weight, the key to your long term permanent success lies much deeper. Even science based diet plans that claim to prove the fastest way to lose body fat won‚Äôt stand the test of time if you are unable to do the most important thing when it comes to nutrition, and that is stay consistent with your approach.In this video, I show you the number one truth about nutrition and losing weight. Without consistency, your chance of keeping off the weight you lost is almost zero. The most important thing you can do is not turn to the latest pubmed studies to supposedly prove how you should be eating but rather determine if the way you decide to eat is going to be something you can do forever.I‚Äôm actually not one to demonize one way of eating over another. Instead, I encourage everyone to adopt the nutrition plan that is most conducive to their lifestyle and is going to be something that they can do for the foreseeable future. This often revolves around a much deeper ideology and one important unavoidable truth.And that is, getting ripped and losing fat is going to take commitment. Period. It is going to take a long term permanent commitment to either spending a bit more time than you are right now or money to get where you want to be. This can be boiled down to a simple three words and how they interplay together to formulate these requirements. These are fast, cheap and good. When it comes to nutrition and eating you can get fast, cheap and good but you can‚Äôt get all three. In fact, you can only choose two of these three options.  In only one world is it possible to get fast, cheap and good nutrition and that is if you are living at home with your parents and they are spending the time, money and effort to prepare your foods for you but even in this example, someone is still sacrificing something - it‚Äôs just not you.More realistically, you are going to have to choose from these other options. In fact, there are only two viable options to diet success since the fast and cheap option is usually one that isn‚Äôt conducive to what you‚Äôre trying to achieve with your body goals. When you go this route you are left with foods that are likely not healthy or good. This is a quick road to disaster and not one that is recommended.This leaves the other two options. If you go the fast and good route then you are likely going to have to take advantage of pre-cooked foods in your local Whole Foods or even start using a meal prep company to provide your meals for you. Both of these are going to require a financial commitment that you may or may not be able or ready to make. On the other hand, if you would prefer to save a good bit of money you can purchase these foods yourself in their raw, natural states and then cook them yourself. This of course if going to take much more time and is going to require that you are willing to make the time commitment to getting this done consistently.  Even if you do a full day meal prep or choose to prepare your meals daily.The fact is, you can‚Äôt escape nutrition commitment when you want to get your diet right and lose weight. Losing body fat is one of the hardest things you can do because it takes a 24/7 commitment that many people can‚Äôt make. Anyone can get themselves to go to the gym for an hour a few times a week but it takes a lot more effort to be conscientious of what you‚Äôre eating for the remaining 23 hours. Don‚Äôt get fooled by quick fixes. There is no such thing when it comes to getting ripped.If you‚Äôre looking for daily guidance on how to make this process much more automatic for you, then I think I can really help you out. My step by step meal plans are available in all of our programs available at the link below, depending on your exact training goals right now.
