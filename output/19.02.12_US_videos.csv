Which they referred to as Resting Fish Face. But then…well something peculiar happened…or I mean…someone peculiar happened.The Boy was... peculiar... from the moment he entered the world. No one ever meant to be mean towards him, but in a town grown used to way things were, no one knew what to do with something... different. They did their very best to ignore it... hoping it would go away... and eventually so did The Boy. He had lost his smile and without it the world grew darker, the wind colder, and the ocean more violent. The Boy was not alone in his melancholy.He wondered what could bring despair to something so beautiful.He tried to ignore the fish, but loneliness is an ocean full of travelers trying to find their place in the world.But without friendship, we are all lost and left with no hope, no home, no harbor. He wondered what cruel twist of fate brought them together, and if fate was indeed involved, what did she have in store.Pre-order Harry Styles’ new album ‘Fine Line’ now: https://HStyles.lnk.to/FineLinePSPAAY HARRY STYLES.

So how can you spot potential signs of cancer in your pets? Pay attention to changes in the way your pet eats and moves, advises Dr. Nick Szigetvari, who is certified in veterinary oncology. In cats, look for minor changes in appetite and grooming, since they may hide their symptoms. In dogs, check for any lumps, swelling, limping or wounds that take longer than a week to heal."

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area.  About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7During the Tesla Cybertruck reveal Elon Musk showed the world that the Cybertruck can pull a Ford F-150, uphill! At initial glance, you might think wow, that's an impressive feat. Surely the Tesla's electric torque helps it rip the F-150 in this battle of who's got the bigger driveshaft? Unfortunately, physics informs us these kind of demonstrations are entirely pointless.We'll discuss the actual wheel torque of the Tesla Cybertruck as well as the Ford F-150, we'll look into both vehicles weights, and we'll analyze the video to determine if the Ford is RWD or 4WD. Ultimately, we'll all land on the conclusion that everything we witnessed was pointless. That's the story of life. Enjoy!

Stand up against people who judge others and use your voice - WEAR IT OUT LOUD! merch back in stock! SHOP http://storybooth.com/store  LIMITED QUANTITIES! Growing up, Lizzie never realized how deeply she was affected by what she saw on the news and experienced at school. But when she took the time to look back, she started to understand that events she experienced really impacted her way of thinking and daily life, and the level of her anxiety. When Lizzie was younger, she lived at Fort Hood - the biggest U.S. military base in the country. She was there when a horrible shooting happened. The day after the horrific event, she went to school and saw armed guards surrounding the building. When she approached a guard, he assured her that he was there to protect her. But because Lizzie was so young, she didn't understand why she needed to be protected at school. At such a young age, the whole thing was really confusing. Then, when Lizzie was in middle school, another student brought a weapon to school. The student was caught before he was able to use his weapon, and the school was able to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. However, even though Lizzie was so grateful that things didn't escalate, the whole experience still really scared her. After that, Lizzie felt a similar sense of fear, confusion and sadness when she heard about the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook. She couldn't imagine how the victims must have felt, and she hugged her younger brother and told him she loved him after hearing about what happened on the news. Then, when Lizzie was a senior in high school, she found out about another tragedy at Stoneman Douglas. As much as it broke her heart to hear about yet another school shooting, Lizzie couldn't help but feel numb to the pain - and that scared her even more. After each event, Lizzie became more anxious in her daily life. When her school had an active shooter drill, she couldn't help but fear the worst, and she immediately texted her brother to make sure he was okay. Lizzie believes that, although this is hard for anyone to comprehend, it is especially difficult for kids and teenagers. She doesn't understand why her generation has to feel any sense of fear when walking into a school, going to a store or heading to a movie. She may think to herself, When did this become normal? However, Lizzie has hope for the future. She thinks that her generation will be the change that the world needs to make a difference, and she is hopeful that future generations will not have experience what Lizzie and her classmates went through.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!
