I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReviewAs they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously.

The microchip launched a technological revolution, created Silicon Valley, and everyone’s got one in their pocket (read: smartphones). When you zoom in on one of these chips, you find a highly complex, nanoscale-sized city that’s expertly designed to send information back and forth.And chip manufacturers continue to shrink the size of microchips, hitting smaller and smaller milestones while also increasing the number of features a chip has. The result is an improved overall processing power. This is what’s been driving the semiconductor industry—a drumbeat called Moore’s Law. Moore's Law is the golden rule in computing: The number of transistors on a microchip can be expected to double every two years, while the cost of computers is cut in half. This basically means we'll have more speed, at less cost, over time. And so, we've been shrinking transistors (the tiny electric switches that process data for everything from clocks to AI algorithms) down to really, really tiny nanoscales.And though we've hit a physical limit on how small these transistors can get, Intel (and a couple other competitors, like Samsung and TSMC) are betting big on something new: EUV Lithography.Find out more about this next generation of chip technology that is taking Moore’s Law to a new level on this episode of Focal Point. #MooresLaw #MicroChip #SiliconValley #Computing #EUVLithography #Seeker #FocalPoint #Science____________________Read More:EUV Lithography Finally Ready for Chip Manufacturinghttps://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/nanotechnology/euv-lithography-finally-ready-for-chip-manufacturing“The giant machine garnering all this attention is an extreme ultraviolet lithography tool. For more than a decade, the semiconductor-manufacturing industry has been alternately hoping EUV can save Moore’s Law and despairing that the technology will never arrive. But it’s finally here, and none too soon.”Moore's Law Keeps Going, Defying Expectationshttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moore-s-law-keeps-going-defying-expectations/“It’s a mystery why Gordon Moore’s “law,” which forecasts processor power will double every two years, still holds true a half century later”Silicon Valley Owes Its Success To This Tech Genius You’ve Never Heard Ofhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/silicon-valley-owes-its-success-tech-genius-youve-never-heard-180961395/“They called Robert Noyce the Mayor of Silicon Valley, but like many in public office, his work wasn’t well known.”____________________Our scientific understanding of the universe is advancing at an unprecedented rate.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial► Edited ByBecky Johnson"
