His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ‚ñ∫ Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial‚ñ∫ Edited ByBecky Johnson","19.04.11","farming simulator-farm life-john deere-tractor videos-millennial farmer-john deere tractors-john deere green-farming simulator 19-farming simulator 20-mn millennial farmer equipment-millennial farmer podcast-mn millennial farmer podcast-mn millennial farmer harvest-millennial farmer harvest-mn millennial farmer-FARMER-millenial farmer-farming-tractor stuck in the mud-millennial farmer equipment-harvest-john deere s780 combine-harvesting corn-corn harvest","297489","15907","138","1853","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IAopbTBIBCI/default.jpg","False","False"
