I love thrifting and looking for old, ugly stuff that I can makeover into a brand new creation. I hope you enjoy!This episode I am using a wooden, 6-drawer storage organizer (I believe from Ikea, although I couldn't find it online). I bought this from a yard sale. It's super boring and plain, so I thought I could make something more interesting out of it. I decided to use this for some of my overflow art and crafting supplies like my ribbon, pom poms, charms, sprinkles, buttons, fake flowers etc. This worked out perfectly to take care of my supply organization and storage.

He was right‚Äîwithin two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he‚Äôs only only getting better with time."

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ‚ñ∫ Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial‚ñ∫ Edited ByBecky Johnson"

LSU nearly doubled Auburn in its offensive output (501-285) on Saturday afternoon and got another efficient effort from quarterback Joe Burrow, who completed 32-of-42 passes for 321 yards with a touchdown and an interception.What kept this game closer than the box score alone suggested it should be were a couple of LSU turnovers. Derek Stingley fumbled a punt in the first half that set up Auburn's first touchdown to give Auburn a 10-7 lead. Later, in the third quarter, Joe Burrow threw an interception at the goal line that would have given LSU a 17-10 lead. Auburn's offense was stagnant all afternoon. It finished with 130 yards rushing in the game, but even that total was a bit misleading as 70 of those yards came on a D.J. Williams run. The Tigers managed only 60 yards rushing on their other 32 carries. Auburn's second touchdown drive didn't come until the final minutes when it was trailing by 10 points. Bo Nix completed just 15-of-35 passes for 157 yards with a score and a pick. LSU's win was its 10th straight at Tiger Stadium and made sure Auburn remained winless in this venue since 1999.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSports FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#SEC #TigerBowl #LSU #Auburn #CollegeFootball"
