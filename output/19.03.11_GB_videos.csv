Basically we partnered with Arbor Day and got them to agree that for every $1 we raise, they would plant 1 tree.MERCH (all proceeds go to Autism Speaks):They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************¬≠I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYou...TWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"
