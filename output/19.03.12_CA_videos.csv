And it involved a clown dancing on a roof.In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox‚Äôs Phil Edwards explores the beginning of rotoscoping, a technique animators can use to create realistic motion. Invented by Max Fleischer of Fleischer Studios (and echoed and practiced by many others), it involves taking filmed footage and using it as a traceable model for animation. The results are fluid and natural in a way animation had never been before.As the above video shows, it started with Max‚Äôs brother Dave dancing on a roof in a clown costume. Footage of that was then used to model the classic Koko the Clown cartoons, which formed the basis for many Fleischer Studios films. Today, animators still use techniques like rotoscoping to turn real movement into animation.Check out the original patent!https://patents.google.com/patent/US1242674A/enIf you want to learn more about early animation, check out Fleischer Studios on the web and YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCAhYwGZxcAPDpu5Q7ueKQYou can also read Man and Superman: The Fleischer Studio Negotiates the Real in Quarterly Review of Film and Video by J.P.

Which they referred to as Resting Fish Face.¬†But then‚Ä¶well something peculiar happened‚Ä¶or I mean‚Ä¶someone peculiar happened.The Boy was... peculiar... from the moment he entered the world. No one ever meant to be mean towards him, but in a town grown used to way things were, no one knew what to do with something... different. They did their very best to ignore it... hoping it would go away... and eventually so did The Boy. He had lost his smile and without it the world grew darker, the wind colder, and the ocean more violent. The Boy was not alone in his melancholy.He wondered what could bring despair to something so beautiful.He tried to ignore the fish, but loneliness is an ocean full of travelers trying to find their place in the world.But without friendship, we are all lost and left with no hope, no home, no harbor.¬†He wondered what cruel twist of fate brought them together, and if fate was indeed involved, what did she have in store.Pre-order Harry Styles‚Äô new album ‚ÄòFine Line‚Äô now: https://HStyles.lnk.to/FineLinePSPAAY HARRY STYLES.

This is the cosmic microwave background radiation - the left-over heat-glow from the very early universe. We can‚Äôt see this microwave light with our eyes, but we can catch it with even a simple radio antenna. As soon as we became aware of its existence we‚Äôve been feverishly building better and better devices to collect it. Why? Because it encodes so many secrets. And within this light, a group of scientists have just found evidence of the limits of space. A clue that our universe may be actually be finite in size. Today on Space Time Journal Club we‚Äôll delve into the Nature Astronomy paper that just reported this: Planck evidence for a closed Universe and a possible crisis for cosmology by Eleonora Di Valentino, Alessandro Melchiorri, and Joe Silk.Special Thanks to Our PatreonsBig BangAlexander TamasAndrew & BrennaCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan BenetMatt MillerMorgan HoughQuasarMark HeisingMark RosenthalVinnie FalcoHypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn PollockJohn R.

So how can you spot potential signs of cancer in your pets? Pay attention to changes in the way your pet eats and moves, advises Dr. Nick Szigetvari, who is certified in veterinary oncology. In cats, look for minor changes in appetite and grooming, since they may hide their symptoms. In dogs, check for any lumps, swelling, limping or wounds that take longer than a week to heal."

Yes, detective movies give a clear answer to this question. Also, scientists have only recently found out that fingerprints serve a person as the main mechanism of touch. Without them, it'd be difficult for you to read information and interact with whatever you're touching or holding in your hands.Patterns on the fingers play a very important role in the fine motor skills of the hands. Thanks to them, we can easily separate thin pages of paper from each other, type on a keyboard, get cards and money from our wallets, play the piano, guitar, etc. But besides that, could fingerprints determine your character?

Remember that when you're sitting at a campfire in nature, you're constantly stretching out your hands in its direction. Also in cold weather, you feel your hands freeze faster than the rest of your body.- Every print of every person is unique. The probability that you'll meet someone with the same finger pattern as yours is 1 in 64 million. Even for twins with the same DNA, the prints vary. - In Ancient Babylon, about 2000 BCE, people left prints on clay tablets as a signature. Then, in the 5-7 centuries, they were used in China for the same purpose. - Scientists have recorded rare cases when a person was born with absolutely smooth fingers, void of prints. Such cases in medicine are considered a manifestation of a rare genetic tendency. - In addition to fingerprints, people also have unique prints on their tongue and feet. And with cats and dogs, nose prints are unique.- The patterns on our fingers can also be an additional tool for reading information. An excellent testimony of this is massage therapists. - Each fingerprint is unique, but nevertheless, there are only three main types of patterns for them: an arch, loops, and a whorl.- The first type is the arch. People with these prints are very responsible, calm and balanced. They don't get mad easily. - The next type is the loop. People with this pattern on their fingers put self-expression and self-development in first place, even if it doesn't bring material benefits.- And the last type is the whorl. The predominance of whorls speaks of well-developed logical and analytical thinking. People with this pattern are better at learning new languages and math.Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/"

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area. About Primitive Technology:Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7During the Tesla Cybertruck reveal Elon Musk showed the world that the Cybertruck can pull a Ford F-150, uphill! At initial glance, you might think wow, that's an impressive feat. Surely the Tesla's electric torque helps it rip the F-150 in this battle of who's got the bigger driveshaft? Unfortunately, physics informs us these kind of demonstrations are entirely pointless.We'll discuss the actual wheel torque of the Tesla Cybertruck as well as the Ford F-150, we'll look into both vehicles weights, and we'll analyze the video to determine if the Ford is RWD or 4WD. Ultimately, we'll all land on the conclusion that everything we witnessed was pointless. That's the story of life. Enjoy!
